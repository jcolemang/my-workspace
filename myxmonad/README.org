* Building

  Using Nix, you can build this XMonad configuration using the following:

  #+BEGIN_SRC nix
  nix-env -f default.nix -i myxmonad
  #+END_SRC

  Otherwise, you can just use stack. You will probably need to modify the
  ~stack.yaml~ file to get rid of the Nix configuration, then can just run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC nix
  stack install
  #+END_SRC
